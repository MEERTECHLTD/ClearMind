Hey [Name]!

I've been working on something for the past few months and I'm finally ready to share it.

It's called ClearMind - a productivity app that actually works the way my brain does.

Here's what makes it different:

🎯 IT'S NOT JUST A TO-DO LIST
Tasks, projects, habits, goals, calendar, daily planning, learning resources, and more. Everything in one place.

🤖 AI-POWERED
Iris (the AI companion) helps break down complex tasks, brainstorm ideas, and keeps you motivated when you're stuck.

🔐 PRIVACY-FIRST
Everything works offline. Your data never leaves your device unless YOU choose to enable cloud sync.

💰 FREE
No premium tier. No ads. No data selling. Just productivity.

Try it: https://clearmind.meertech.tech

Takes 10 seconds to get started. No signup required.

Would love your feedback!

Cheers,
[Your name]

P.S. - It works as a PWA, so you can install it on your phone like a native app. Just visit the link and tap "Add to Home Screen"!

## 🎙️ Podcast/Interview Talking Points

```
WHAT IS CLEARMIND?
"ClearMind is an AI-powered productivity app that combines 16 different tools into one cohesive experience. Think Notion meets Things 3 meets Habitica - but simpler and privacy-focused."

WHY DID YOU BUILD IT?
"I was tired of using 5-6 different apps just to stay organized. Todoist for tasks, Notion for projects, Streaks for habits, Google Calendar for events... I wanted everything in one place, working offline, with my data staying on my device."

WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT?
"Three things: 
1. It's truly offline-first - works without internet, cloud sync is optional
2. AI is built in naturally - not forced. Iris helps when you need it.
3. It's designed for real workflows - from students to enterprise project managers"

FAVORITE FEATURES?
"The Daily Mapper is what I use most. You plan your entire day in time blocks, then mark each as done or not. You can even set permanent tasks that auto-appear on workdays vs weekends.

And the Learning Vault - it saves YouTube videos, podcasts, courses with auto-fetched metadata. I never lose a resource anymore."

WHAT'S NEXT?
"Recurring tasks, Pomodoro timer, team collaboration, and a mobile app. But I'm also listening to users - the roadmap is shaped by real feedback."
